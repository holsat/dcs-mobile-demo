# Environment Variables
#
# This project does not require any environment variables for local development.
# All content is loaded from the public DCS website at https://dcs.goarch.org
#
# Expo provides built-in environment variables:
# - EXPO_OS: Platform detection (ios, android, web) - automatically set by Expo
# - EXPO_PUBLIC_*: Public environment variables (not currently used)
#
# If you need to add environment variables in the future:
# 1. Create a .env file (gitignored by default)
# 2. Use EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-accessible variables
# 3. Access them via process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_YOUR_VAR_NAME
#
# Example:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
